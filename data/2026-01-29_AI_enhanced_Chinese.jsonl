While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object. This learned scale enables us to convert single-view 3D reconstructions into true-to-life, physically meaningful models. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two publicly available datasets show that our method consistently outperforms existing techniques, achieving nearly a 30% reduction in mean absolute volume-estimation error, showcasing its potential to enhance the domain of precision nutrition.

To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner.

In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information.

Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps.

To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space.

Studies show that, under homogeneous agents and uniform belief updates, debate preserves expected correctness and therefore cannot reliably improve outcomes. Drawing on findings from human deliberation and collective decision-making, we identify two key mechanisms missing from vanilla MAD: (i) diversity of initial viewpoints and (ii) explicit, calibrated confidence communication. We propose two lightweight interventions. First, a diversity-aware initialisation that selects a more diverse pool of candidate answers, increasing the likelihood that a correct hypothesis is present at the start of debate. Second, a confidence-modulated debate protocol in which agents express calibrated confidence and condition their updates on others' confidence.

To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-Agnostic Evolution ($\\mathtt{PAE}$), which strengthens vision prompt tuning by explicitly modeling prompt dynamics.

However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

To explore LLM's potential in assisting scientific review, this study examined ChatGPT-5, Gemini-3-Pro, and Claude-Sonnet-4.5's consistency and reliability in evaluating abstracts compared to one another and to human reviewers. Methods: 160 abstracts from a local conference were graded by human reviewers and three LLMs using one rubric. Composite score distributions across three LLMs and fourteen reviewers were examined. Inter-rater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for within-AI reliability and AI-human concordance. Bland-Altman plots were examined for visual agreement patterns and systematic bias. Results: LLMs achieved good-to-excellent agreement with each other (ICCs: 0.59-0.87). ChatGPT and Claude reached moderate agreement with human reviewers on overall quality and content-specific criteria, with ICCs ~.45-.60 for composite, impression, clarity, objective, and results. They exhibited fair agreement on subjective dimensions, with ICC ranging from 0.23-0.38 for impact, engagement, and applicability. Gemini showed fair agreement on half criteria and no reliability on impact and applicability. Three LLMs showed acceptable or negligible mean difference (ChatGPT=0.24, Gemini=0.42, Claude=-0.02) from the human mean composite scores. Discussion: LLMs could process abstracts in batches with moderate agreement with human experts on overall quality and objective criteria. With appropriate process architecture, they can apply a rubric consistently across volumes of abstracts exceeding feasibility for a human rater.

Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space. We also introduce a ConvNeXt-based encoder and design a loss function that combines classification and consistency objectives to drive effective adaptation directly from the target domain.

However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process. Subsequently, semantic supervision strategy with spatial intelligence is introduced, which integrates the functions of visual perception and spatial reasoning, thus prompting the model to achieve accurate enhancement. Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation.

Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process.

To address this limitation, we propose PalmBridge, a plug-and-play feature-space alignment framework for open-set palmprint verification based on vector quantization. Rather than relying solely on data-level augmentation, PalmBridge learns a compact set of representative vectors directly from training features. During enrollment and verification, each feature vector is mapped to its nearest representative vector under a minimum-distance criterion, and the mapped vector is then blended with the original vector. This design suppresses nuisance variation induced by domain shifts while retaining discriminative identity cues. The representative vectors are jointly optimized with the backbone network using task supervision, a feature-consistency objective, and an orthogonality regularization term to form a stable and well-structured shared embedding space. Furthermore, we analyze feature-to-representative mappings via assignment consistency and collision rate to assess model's sensitivity to blending weights.

We introduce FFEHallu, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating figurative hallucination in LLMs, with a focus on Persian, a linguistically rich yet underrepresented language.

Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that HINT matches the performance of strong offline models and surpasses autoregressive baselines.

However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts.

Experiments were conducted on a curated subset of MIMIC III, (four structured tables and one clinical note type), using a mix of locally hosted and API-based LLMs. Evaluation combined exact-match metrics, semantic similarity, and human judgment. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to support precise querying and accurate information extraction in clinical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "tags": [], "score": 3, "recommendation_reason": "No recommendation reason provided"}}

While multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has shown promise in enhancing VQA systems by providing more evidence on both image and text sides, the default procedure that addresses VQA queries, especially the knowledge-intensive ones, often relies on multi-stage pipelines of mRAG with inherent dependencies. To mitigate the inefficiency limitations while maintaining VQA task performance, this paper proposes a method that trains a multimodal planning agent, dynamically decomposing the mRAG pipeline to solve the VQA task. Our method optimizes the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness by training the agent to intelligently determine the necessity of each mRAG step. In our experiments, the agent can help reduce redundant computations, cutting search time by over 60\\% compared to existing methods and decreasing costly tool calls. Meanwhile, experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms all baselines, including a Deep Research agent and a carefully designed prompt-based method, on average over six various datasets.

Reverse engineering continues to threaten software security, while traditional virtual machine protection (VMP) relies on rigid, rule-based transformations that are costly to design and vulnerable to automated analysis. In this work, we present the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code. Our approach builds large-scale paired datasets of source code and normalized VM implementations, and introduces hierarchical dependency modeling at intra-, preceding-, and inter-instruction levels. We jointly optimize language modeling with functionality-aware and protection-aware contrastive objectives to capture both semantic equivalence and protection strength. To further assess resilience, we propose a protection effectiveness optimization task that quantifies and ranks different VM variants derived from the same source. Coupled with a two-stage continual pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline, our method enables models to generate, compare, and reason over protected code. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly improves robustness across diverse protection levels, opening a new research direction for learning-based software defense. In this work, we present ShieldedCode, the first protection-aware framework that learns robust representations of VMP-protected code.

We investigate the replacement of HDBSCAN (offline clustering) with online (streaming/incremental) clustering methods in a production narrative report generation pipeline. The proposed system employs a three-stage architecture (data collection, modeling, dashboard generation) that processes thousands of multilingual social media documents daily. While HDBSCAN excels at discovering hierarchical density-based clusters and handling noise, its batch-only nature necessitates complete retraining for each time window, resulting in memory constraints, computational inefficiency, and inability to adapt to evolving narratives in real-time. This work evaluates a bunch of online clustering algorithms across dimensions of cluster quality preservation, computational efficiency, memory footprint, and integration compatibility with existing workflows. We propose evaluation criteria that balance traditional clustering metrics (Silhouette Coefficient, Davies-Bouldin Index) with narrative metrics (narrative distinctness, contingency and variance). Our methodology includes sliding-window simulations on historical datasets from Ukraine information space, enabling comparative analysis of algorithmic trade-offs in realistic operational contexts.

Current benchmarks, however, remain largely static, relying on passive retrieval tasks that fail to simulate the complexities of agent-environment interaction, such as non-linear reasoning and iterative feedback. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AgentLongBench}, which evaluates agents through simulated environment rollouts based on Lateral Thinking Puzzles. This framework generates rigorous interaction trajectories across knowledge-intensive and knowledge-free scenarios. Experiments with state-of-the-art models and memory systems (32K to 4M tokens) expose a critical weakness: while adept at static retrieval, agents struggle with the dynamic information synthesis essential for workflows. Our analysis indicates that this degradation is driven by the minimum number of tokens required to resolve a query.

We investigate whether explicit information about a subject's gender or sexuality influences LLM responses across three subject categories: queer-marked, non-queer-marked, and the normalized \"unmarked\" category. Representational imbalances are operationalized as measurable differences in English sentence completions across four dimensions: sentiment, regard, toxicity, and prediction diversity. Our findings show that Masked Language Models (MLMs) produce the least favorable sentiment, higher toxicity, and more negative regard for queer-marked subjects. Autoregressive Language Models (ARLMs) partially mitigate these patterns, while closed-access ARLMs tend to produce more harmful outputs for unmarked subjects. Results suggest that LLMs reproduce normative social assumptions, though the form and degree of bias depend strongly on specific model characteristics, which may redistribute, but not eliminate, representational harms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "tags": [], "score": 3, "recommendation_reason": "No recommendation reason provided"}}

Grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model and therapeutic alliance theory, we develop a theory-informed annotation framework and apply a hybrid LLM-human pipeline to analyze evaluative language, adoption-related attitudes, and relational alignment at scale. Our results show that engagement is shaped primarily by narrated outcomes, trust, and response quality, rather than emotional bond alone. Positive sentiment is most strongly associated with task and goal alignment, while companionship-oriented use more often involves misaligned alliances and reported risks such as dependence and symptom escalation.

While Persona prompting (PP) is increasingly used as a way to steer model towards user-specific generation, its effect on model rationales remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-generated rationales vary when conditioned on different simulated demographic personas. Using datasets annotated with word-level rationales, we measure agreement with human annotations from different demographic groups, and assess the impact of PP on model bias and human alignment. Our evaluation across three LLMs results reveals three key findings: (1) PP improving classification on the most subjective task (hate speech) but degrading rationale quality. (2) Simulated personas fail to align with their real-world demographic counterparts, and high inter-persona agreement shows models are resistant to significant steering. (3) Models exhibit consistent demographic biases and a strong tendency to over-flag content as harmful, regardless of PP. Our findings reveal a critical trade-off: while PP can improve classification in socially-sensitive tasks, it often comes at the cost of rationale quality and fails to mitigate underlying biases, urging caution in its application.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed", "tags": [], "score": 3, "recommendation_reason": "No recommendation reason provided"}}
